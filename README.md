Bytesrw â€“ Composable byte stream readers and writers for OCaml
==============================================================

Bytesrw extends the OCaml `Bytes` module with composable, memory
efficient, byte stream readers and writers compatible with effect
based concurrency.

Except for byte slice life-times, these abstractions intentionally
separate away ressource management and the specifics of reading and
writing bytes.

Bytesrw distributed under the ISC license. It has no dependencies.

Optional support for compressed, hashed and encrypted bytes depend, at
your wish, on the C [`zlib`], [`libzstd`], [`blake3`], [`libmd`],
[`xxhash`] and  [`mbedtls`] libraries.

[`libzstd`]: http://zstd.net
[`libmd`]: https://www.hadrons.org/software/libmd/
[`xxhash`]: https://xxhash.com/
[`zlib`]: https://zlib.net
[`mbedtls`]: https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls

## Installation

Bytesrw can be installed with `opam`

    opam install bytesrw
    
    # Compression support
    opam install bytesrw conf-zlib conf-zstd
    
    # Hashing support
    opam install bytesrw conf-libblake3 conf-libmd conf-xxhash
    
    # Cryptography (and hashing) support 
    opam install conf-mbedtsl
    
    # certown tool 
    opam install bytesrw conf-mbedtls b0 cmdliner

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation can be consulted [online] or via `odig doc bytesrw`.

Questions are welcome but better asked on the [OCaml forum] than on the
issue tracker.

## Examples

A few examples can be found in the [test](test/) directory. 

## Acknowledgments 

A grant from the [OCaml Software Foundation] helped to bring the first
public release of `bytesrw`. Another one funded the cryptography support.
