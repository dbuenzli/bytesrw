Bytesrw â€“ Composable byte stream readers and writers for OCaml
==============================================================

Bytesrw extends the OCaml `Bytes` module with composable, memory
efficient, byte stream readers and writers compatible with effect
based concurrency.

Except for byte slice life-times, these abstractions intentionnaly
separate away ressource management and the specifics of reading and
writing bytes.

Bytesrw distributed under the ISC license. It has no dependencies.
