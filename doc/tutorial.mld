{1:positions Stream positions}

For many usages stream positions are irrelevant. However one should
pay attention to them when devising readers and writers so that errors
are reported accurately.

Byte reader and writers maintain a stream position which is the
zero-based index of the next byte to read or write. This value
can also be intepreted as the number of bytes that have been
read or written.
