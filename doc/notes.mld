{0 Design notes}

- We settle on [length]s rather than [sizes] because that's what
  the [Stdlib] generally uses.

- We use [first], [last] and [length] for slice indexing and [pos],
  [parent_pos] for streams. That way the terminology does not overlap
  which makes it for a clearer exposition. Indentally our usage of
  [pos] is constent with the [Stdlib] (though the index vs position
  terminology should not have been introduced in my opinion).

- The design tries to enforce well formed streams. For example no
  spurious empty slices (they terminate streams), or calls to
  enumerators and iterators after eod. In particular in {!Bytes.Slice}
  we mention in the names that users are made aware that they may
  produce {!Slice.eod} since producing or pushing them terminates
  streams.

- No arbitrary getter/setter on mutable fields and changing them makes
  a new reader/writer (not in the applicative sense, we don't deal
  with purely functional structures). This is by design so that reader
  and writer filters part a composition can't fiddle with these
  fields. Also for now we decided to hide this function.

{1:upstream Upstreaming}

A few things to consider if we want, {b after we have determined that
this API works well}, to upstream {!Bytesrw.Bytes}.

- The labels with lengths are not abbreviated, we have [~length] and
  [~slice_length], the Stdlib uses [~len]. A counter here is to
  mention that this corresponds to the name of the fields
  of the structures and there is little point to invent new names
  (and say {!Slice.len} would by inconsistent with
  [{String,Bytes}.length]).

- The [?first ?last] subrange interface was rejected by upstream for
  strings. For wrong reasons in my opinion. Aesthetics of [+/-1]
  (counter 1: clarity; counter 2: depends on your use case, you then
  also need to add +/-1) and provability (?). It's a pity since it's a
  very usable interface that avoids a lot of footgunish index
  computations and brings general code clarity. In general you want
  both a position + length and an inclusive range interface (and FWIW
  it's also consistent with OCaml's own inclusive [for] loop).

- Dependencies. A few things will need to be dispatched differently
  module wise, basically the channel stuff should move to the
  [{In,Out}channel] modules and the buffer stuff to the [Buffer]
  module. And the formatters won't make it or will end up in the
  long-winded [Format]. But I don't think any functionality would be
  lost except perhaps the nice hex dump formatter {!Bytes.pp_hex}
  which is maybe too much code.
