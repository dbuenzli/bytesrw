name: "bytesrw"
synopsis: "Composable byte stream readers and writers for OCaml"
description: """\
Bytesrw extends the OCaml `Bytes` module with composable, memory
efficient, byte stream readers and writers compatible with effect
based concurrency.

Except for byte slice life-times, these abstractions intentionally
separate away ressource management and the specifics of reading and
writing bytes.

Bytesrw distributed under the ISC license. It has no dependencies.

Optional support for compressed, hashed and encrypted bytes depend, at
your wish, on the C [`zlib`], [`libzstd`], [`blake3`], [`libmd`],
[`xxhash`] and  [`mbedtls`] libraries.

[`blake3`]: https://blake3.io
[`libzstd`]: http://zstd.net
[`libmd`]: https://www.hadrons.org/software/libmd/
[`xxhash`]: https://xxhash.com/
[`zlib`]: https://zlib.net
[`mbedtls`]: https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls
